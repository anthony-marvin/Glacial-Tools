Welcome to the Glacial Shortcodes readme!

1. Using Shortcodes
2. Codes and what they do!


1. Using Shortcodes
  The best way to use shortcodes is to type them like this [your shortcode]. Glacial shortcodes are very simple and easy to use. To use them, simply type [g_*] and to finish using a glacial shortcode, type [/g_*], where the * are the particular code you want. Glacial Shortcodes are based on responsive, 12 section grid layouts, much like bootstrap and webflow are based on.
